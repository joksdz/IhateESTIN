NOTE : start form the coulombs law from the basics for this chapter [[Basics-elect]]


## Electric field of point charges 
form hte images below we can see that the electric field of a positive charge is pointing outwards

while the negative charge points inwards ![[Pasted image 20251020213413.png]]

while the vector representation of two negative and positive charges is

## charge distribution : 
(collection of charges)
imagine a line that is positively charged with an equal charge distribution meaning $\lambda$ which is:$$\lambda = \frac{q}{l}(\frac{c}{m})$$
for example we take $\lambda=20$ which means that for every 1 meter of the wire there are 20 charges and when we say that its equally distributive means that in every piece of the wire there are equal amount of charges so the density of the charges in a given piece of a wire is the same everywhere 
## types : 
There are mainly 3(4) types : 
![[Pasted image 20251020215301.png]]
- ### Linear charge distribution : 
$\lambda=$ charge per unit length , the unit is coulomb per meter as explained above  (C/m)
- ### surface charge density :
$\sigma=$ charge per unit area, the unit coulomb per square meter   (C/m^2)
 - ### volume charge density : 
 $\rho=$  charge per unit length , the unit coulomb per cube meter  (C/m^3)
 for a line charge ,a surface charge and a volume charge the summation in the definition of an electric field becomes an integral and $q_i$ is replaced by $dq=\lambda\space{dl},\sigma{}dA,\rho{}dV$

the "trick" in solving these equations is almost always to coming with the correct expression of dl ,dA , dV
==Note:== 
the meaning of r here changes in every one of these 
also we are using $\vec{E}$ as a notation to represent the 3 vectors on the 3 axes which is actually this :
