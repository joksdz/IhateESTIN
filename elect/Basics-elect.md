### What is Electricity ? 
Electricity is a form of energy produced by the circulation of electrical charges inside of a conductor or a semi-conductor .

## types of electrification : 
- ### electrification by friction : 
the generation of electric charge on objects through friction between them .
- ### Electrification by contact : 
the transfer of electric charge from one object to another through direct contact . 
- ### Electrification by induction : 
- the redistribution of electric charge in an object due to that influence of a nearby charged object without direct contact 
## Coulomb's law : 
consider a system of two point charges q1 q2 separated by a distance in a vacuum the force exerted by q1 on q2 is given by coulomb's law $$\vec{F}12 = Ke . \frac{q1.q2}{r^2}. \hat{r} $$
where Ke is the coulomb constant , nad $\hat{r}=\vec{r}/r$ is a unit vector directed from q1 to q2 :

Note: the electrical force is a vector which has both a magnitude and a direction . In IS units,the coulomb constant Ke is given by : $$K{e} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon} =9.9875.10^9 N.m^2/C^2 
$$
where : 
$$\epsilon_0 =  \frac{1}{4\pi(8.99.10^9)} = 8.85.10^{-12} C^2/(m^2.N^2)$$
is known as the permittivity of free space . the force if q1 on q2 is given by $\vec{F_{21}}=-\vec{F_{12}}$ as its shown in (b)  
def of the $\epsilon_0$ :
-- The permittivity of free space is **a physical constant that reflects the ability of electrical fields to pass through a classical vacuum**

## Principle of superposition : 
any pair of point charges in subjected to coulomb's law . when there are more than two charges, the net force on each charge is just the vector sum of the forces that the other charges are applying to it. for instance , if there are three charges , the resultant force felt by charge q3 from charges q1 and q2 will be: 
$$\vec{F_3} = \vec{F_{1/3} + \vec{F_{2/3}}}$$

## Electric Field : 
Like the gravitational force the electrostatic force also acts at a distance ,even when the objects are not in direct contact, In order to defend this idea ,we explain how action at a distance works by claiming that one charge generates a field that interacts with another charge 
An electric charge q produces an electric field everywhere . to quantify the strength of the field created by that charge , we can measure the force and a  positive 'test charge' q0 experiences at some point . the electric field $\vec{E_0}$ is deified as :$$\vec{E_0} =\lim_{q0 \to 0} \frac{\vec{F_e}}{q_0}$$
we take q0 to be infinitesimally small so that the field q0 generated does not disturb the "source charges " the analogy between the electric field and the gravitational field : 
$$\vec{g} = \lim_{m_o \to 0}\frac{\vec{F_m}}{m_0}$$ is depicted in the figure :

using the superposition principle, the total electrical field due to a group of electrical charges is calculated trough the sum of all the electrical field vectors $$\vec{E_T} =\sum_i{\vec{E_i}} =\sum_i{\frac{q_i}{4\pi\epsilon_0.r_i^2}}.\hat{r} $$
