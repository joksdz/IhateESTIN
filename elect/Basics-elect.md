a### What is Electricity ? 
Electricity is a form of energy produced by the circulation of electrical charges inside of a conductor or a semi-conductor .
### How does it move ? 
certain materials like metals (aluminum ,copper ) because they have electrons that they can be liberated from the attraction of the core to participate in the electrical conduction  where as there are other materials that are can insulators where electrical chargers cant move .

### What is electrokinetic  ? 
it is the study of the movement of electrical charges and its phenomenons,when can do so because the movement of charges in a conductor isn't instant but close to the speed of light $$c= 3*10^8 m/s$$
#### receptors
are devices that transform electrical energy to different forms of energies 
#### The role of a generator
is not to manufacture charges but to move the free charges that are already in the conductive material and the movement of these electrical charges is what we call the current (I)  

### Electrical charges and Electrical current 
the elementary charge "-q" is the one of an electron which is represented by the unit Coulomb (C) which take the value : 
$$ -q =-1.6*10^{-19} C$$
the charges that move can be positive (positive ions) but the majority that contributes to electrical conduction are electrons 

### How does it work ? 
In a conductor with cross-section 1 cm^2 , the mobile charges (electrons) move randomly due to collisions, and since there is no electric field and them moving in every direction at once, their average contribution to current is zero.(the last part basically means that because they are moving in multiple directions and not in one direction making the amount of charge that is moving in the one direction the same as any other which the sum of is 0  ) (and this is why there is no electricity in a random wire not because there are no charges but their movement is so random that they can't make a current, they need an electrical field )

their speed is represented by : 
$$ \vec{V} = \mu*\vec{E}$$
where V : is the speed vector 
E : is the electrical field vector 
$\mu$: is the mobility of the charges which uses the unit $m^2 /(v*s)$

now in the span of 1 second the number of charges that passes through the surface $\vec{dS}$ is : 
$$N = \vec{v}.n.\vec{dS}.dt=\vec{v}.n.1cm^2.1s$$
where n is the density of the charges which means the number of mobile charges per unite volume of the conductor 

which makes the the electric charge the passes through the section in 1 second : 
$$dQ = qN=q.\vec{v}.n.\vec{dS}.dt$$

==.== The flux of electrons (i.e., the flow of mobile charge carriers through the cross-section of a conductor) is what we call the electric current I.which is represented by the unite ampére or amps (A)

$$I = \frac{dQ}{dt} = \vec{J}.\vec{dS}$$

$\vec{J}$  is the density of the current which has the unite of $A.m^{-2}$ 
which is tied to the speed of the mobile charges and the volumetric density of the local charges : 
$$\vec{J}=p.\vec{V}$$
which can be expressed as : 
$$\vec{J}= p.\mu.\vec{E} = \sigma\vec{E} $$
$\sigma$: is the electrical conductivity of the conductor uses simens per meters (S/m)


## types of electrification : 
- ### electrification by friction : 
the generation of electric charge on objects through friction between them .
- ### Electrification by contact : 
the transfer of electric charge from one object to another through direct contact . 
- ### Electrification by induction : 
- the redistribution of electric charge in an object due to that influence of a nearby charged object without direct contact 
## Coulomb's law : 
consider a system of two point charges q1 q2 separated by a distance in a vacuum the force exerted by q1 on q2 is given by coulomb's law $$\vec{F}12 = Ke . \frac{q1.q2}{r^2}. \hat{r} $$
where Ke is the coulomb constant , nad $\hat{r}=\vec{r}/r$ is a unit vector directed from q1 to q2 :

Note: the electrical force is a vector which has both a magnitude and a direction . In IS units,the coulomb constant Ke is given by : $$K{e} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon} =9.9875.10^9 N.m^2/C^2 \$$
$$
where : 
$$\epsilon_0 =  \frac{1}{4\pi(8.99.10^9)} = 8.85.10^{-12} C^2/(m^2.N^2)$$
is known as the permittivity of free space . the force if q1 on q2 is given by $\vec{F_{21}}=-\vec{F_{12}}$ as its shown in (b)  
def of the $\epsilon_0$ :
-- The permittivity of free space is **a physical constant that reflects the ability of electrical fields to pass through a classical vacuum**

## Principle of superposition : 
any pair of point charges in subjected to coulomb's law . when there are more than two charges, the net force on each charge is just the vector sum of the forces that the other charges are applying to it. for instance , if there are three charges , the resultant force felt by charge q3 from charges q1 and q2 will be: 
$$\vec{F_3} = \vec{F_{1/3} + \vec{F_{2/3}}}$$

## Electric Field : 
Like the gravitational force the electrostatic force also acts at a distance ,even when the objects are not in direct contact, In order to defend this idea ,we explain how action at a distance works by claiming that one charge generates a field that interacts with another charge 
An electric charge q produces an electric field everywhere . to quantify the strength of the field created by that charge , we can measure the force and a  positive 'test charge' q0 experiences at some point . the electric field $\vec{E_0}$ is deified as :$$\vec{E_0} =\lim_{q0 \to 0} \frac{\vec{F_e}}{q_0}$$
we take q0 to be infinitesimally small so that the field q0 generated does not disturb the "source charges " the analogy between the electric field and the gravitational field : 
$$\vec{g} = \lim_{m_o \to 0}\frac{\vec{F_m}}{m_0}$$ is depicted in the figure : 
![[Pasted image 20251017123040.png]]
using the superposition principle, the total electrical field due to a group of electrical charges is calculated trough the sum of all the electrical field vectors $$\vec{E_T} =\sum_i{\vec{E_i}} =\sum_i{\frac{q_i}{4\pi\epsilon_0.r_i^2}}.\hat{r} $$
